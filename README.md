# Wombot Collager

User inputs a 2d array of prompts and the collager composites the images together mirroring the 2d array submitted.

Built upon unofficial API for [wombo.art](https://app.wombo.art/).

## Installation

First, clone this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ElliotRoe/wombot/
cd wombot
npm install
```

Then, copy the `secret-template.json` and rename it to `secret.json`, and fill out the required entries for your usage:

- for the CLI interface, you only need to input `identify_key`
- for the bot, you need to provide all of the entries

The `identify_key` token is meant to be kept private, so you shouldn't write it into your source code but rather into an outside file, ignored by your VCS.

## Usage

- Modify the input.json file to change the prompt array
- Then run the collager.js file with node

```sh
node collager.js
```

## Legal disclaimer

The code in this repository is provided to you AS IS, without any kind of warranty.
I'm not a lawyer of any kind and I don't know copyright law, so this is only my opinion and not legal advice.

I am not liable for whatever you do with it.
[Wombo.ai](https://wombo.ai/) states in their [Terms of Service](https://wombo.ai/terms/) that they own whatever "Original Content" their software "has".
If this includes images generated by the AI (which is still a gray area, from what I could read), then you cannot post anything from them, even if you got a paid subscription or if you're sharing the "trading card" preview (the one with the watermark), unless they send you a letter with the rights.

Because uploading the images to discord requires you to give discord the rights to reproduce the image on their app, using the discord bot is also gray.

Whether copies for private use made using the unofficial API are legal or not is debatable.
This script only reproduces the sequence of requests made by the website and downloads data already downloaded by the website and shown to the user, albeit only temporarily.
One could open the Developer Tools on the official website and download the same version there.
That being said, I don't know the laws regarding browsers and copyright, and whether or not automated scripts count as legitimate use, so don't take my word on that.
